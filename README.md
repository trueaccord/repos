## Retirement Announcement
At this point in time, we've decided to retire the Repos project and place it into maintenance mode.

We'd like to extend a huge thanks and our gratitude to all of the contributors to this project that 
have helped us to get this project to where it is today and for accompanying us on this journey!

If you run into any issues with this project that you believe require attention from us going forward, 
please reach out to anybody who is a part of the 
[trueaccord/Engineering](https://github.com/orgs/trueaccord/teams/engineering) team to report the 
issues and work with us on resolving those.
